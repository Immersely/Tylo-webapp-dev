      "    \"full_text\": \"The amplitude for this process is not simply the product of amplitudes for single photon processes, rather it must reflect the cross correlation between the same field at two different points and at two different times. That is to say, it must consist of both reducible, single photon terms and irreducible cross terms. Our work here is to deduce the general form for this irreducible part and connect it to the microscopic interaction between pairs of atoms in the cavity. Our model draws inspiration from the work by Milonni21 which considers correlation between two photodetectors, taking into account the time-retardation of the field generated by one atom and felt by the second atom. A simpler version of this which does not take into account the time retardation is presented in Ref. 22 for the case of the direct detection of one photon, given the presence of another and hearkens back to even earlier work by Fermi.23 S(2)(\\u03c91,\\u03c92;\\u03c91\\u2032,\\u03c92\\u2032) which transforms a two-photon input state Here, we denote photon creation operators B^\\u2020(\\u03c91) and B^\\u2020(\\u03c92) acting on the photon vacuum state |0\\u27e9. We shall leave the exact representation of the scattering matrix, S(2)(\\u03c91,\\u03c92;\\u03c91\\u2032,\\u03c92\\u2032)\\u2060, undefined at the moment. The key to understanding entanglement is separability. An entangled two-particle state cannot be written as a product of two single-particle states. This separability can be quantified by performing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the two-particle amplitude function. This is also termed Schmidt decomposition. Suppose we write the input amplitude as F(\\u03c91,\\u03c92) and perform SVD on this function In this case, two independent photons are transmitted without any interaction leading to them being unentangled. Suppose, however, that interactions leading to entanglement are weak such that we can write the two photon scattering amplitude as perturbation expansion of the form whereby So(2)=S(1)S(1) is separable into single photon terms and V mediates the interaction between photon pairs via the resonant cavity. This suggests the following diagrammatic expansion: where solid lines are S(1) free propagators and springs denote the interaction. Such interactions introduce nonlinearity in the form of cross correlations (i.e., scattering) between otherwise uncoupled single photon processes. For the special case of elastic scattering, V(\\u03c9) contributes a phase-shift of the form is separable in terms of the individual photon amplitudes. It is worth mentioning that the output biphoton state is not normalized due to the entanglement parameter \\u03be. Therefore, the proposed formalism could account for signal attenuation and disentanglement effect resulting from the matter-mediated photon coupling. The expansion in Eq. (19) is in the form of a Schmidt decomposition, which we shall discuss in Sec. II B 2. Taking \\u03d5 \\u2192 0 for convenience and letting \\u03be < 1, it becomes trivial to write that the normalized Schmidt coefficients are given by as \\u03bbn2=\\u03be2n(1\\u2212\\u03be2) producing a von Neumann entropy This shows that there exists a 1:1 correspondence between the non-linear coupling \\u03be and the resultant von Neumann entropy, S. In principle, the phase \\u03d5 introduced in Eq. (15) depends upon the microscopic details of the system, such as the relative orientation of the atomic or molecular scattering sites within the sample, and may merely be a random quantity. Averaging over phase, we write In this case, the relative phase is completely randomized and the biphoton amplitude collapses exactly into the product of two single photon terms On the other hand, suppose the phase is normally distributed about a central value, which we can take to be zero, i.e., \\u03d5\\u00af=0 and \\u03d52\\u00af=\\u03c32\\u2060. Here, the average over \\u03d5 can be cast as Fin(\\u03c91,\\u03c92) is transformed to an output biphoton state with the amplitude up to the factor of Fig. 1 for various choices of spectral parameters. Furthermore, one can conclude that the resulting state is not necessarily separable into the product of two functions due to the nontrivial von Neumann entropy II B 2), which gives a useful means of quantifying the entanglement of these states. Schmidt decomposition of Eq. Fig. 2 where we have plotted the von Neumann entropy with respect to the interaction parameter 25,26 we identify the boundary condition on the left boundary of the cavity with the mode leakage rate b^j,in\\u2020(t)+b^j,r\\u2020(t)=\\u03bajb^j\\u2020(t)\\u2060. This connects the input photon operator defined above, the reflected photon operator bj\\u2020(t)\\u2060. The reflected mode is not measured in experiment and will not be considered below. However, the cavity mode operator contains information on the interactions within the cavity and will be determined below. Time domain cavity output operators can be expressed in terms of the photon operators outside the cavity as8 where angle brackets describe the average of the output operators over the material induced cavity mode fluctuations. Similar to the input mode, we establish the following boundary condition on the cavity right boundary: b^j,out\\u2020(t)=\\u03bajb^j\\u2020(t)\\u2060. This condition assumes the same cavity leakage, \\u03baj, and no input photons on the right. Taking into account this boundary condition, evaluation of the output state using Eq. (34) reduces to the evaluation of the time domain correlation function of the cavity mode operators that will directly result in the evaluation of the desired scattering amplitude. We adopt the following stochastic Hamiltonian to describe cavity photon modes b^j\\u2020 coupled to the input and output biphoton states: Here, \\u03b4\\u03c9^j=\\u03b4\\u03c9^j(t) is the time-dependent photon frequency fluctuations of each mode. \\u00a0Appendix B provides an example connecting such a generic Hamiltonian with a microscopic Hamiltonian describing photon wave packet scattering by fluctuations of delocalized polariton modes within the cavity. For the sake of generality, we defined the polariton mode fluctuations as operators, which requires handling of \\u03b4\\u03c9^j=\\u03b4\\u03c9^j(t) as operators. The c-number stochastic limit is trivial. Applying the input-output formalism to the cavity modes described by the Hamiltonian (35), one obtains the quantum Langevin equation8,27 where exp+[\\u2026] is a positive time ordered exponential. Here, the cavity right boundary condition is also applied to express the cavity mode operator in terms of the cavity output mode. According to Eq. (37), the output single and two-photon operators averaged over the fluctuations can be represented as Here, \\u03b8(t) is the Heaviside theta-function and angle brackets indicate average over the frequency fluctuations. Substitution of Eqs. (39) and (41) into Eq. (34) provides an expression for the output biphoton state in terms of the scattering amplitude and biphoton input states. Diagrammatic techniques can be developed for single- and two-photon scattering amplitudes via power series expansion of the exponentials in Eqs. (40) and (41). Instead, we adopt a second cumulant approximation setting all odd point correlation functions in the expansion to zero and partitioning the rest into various products of two-point correlation functions. Summation of the resulting power series gives rise to the following representation of the single- and two-photon scattering amplitudes:28,29 In Eqs. (42) and (43), the second cumulant function gj depends on the jth frequency autocorrelation function as In the limit of fast modulation where \\u03c312\\u03c4\\u00af12\\u226a1\\u2060, only the following four time-ordered contributions (denoted by g12+\\u2060) survive: (45), we can compute the von Neumann entropy for the scattered biphoton state, whereas above, we computed this in the frequency domain, and the scattering matrix (44) into separable components. Since this is a product of separable and nonseparable terms, we only need to decompose the scattering kernel [Eq. In the limit of fast modulation, where \\u03c312\\u03c4\\u00af12\\u226a1\\u2060, the exponent of the cross correlation function is separable in terms of the times [Eqs. (50)\\u2013(53)], and consequently, the entropy of the out-going state is exactly equal to 0. This makes sense since in this limit the cross correlation function depends only upon the intermediate two times in the time-ordering. In other words, the only way for photon 1 to interact with photon 2 is if the polarization created by the first persists long enough to influence the second photon. Else, no entanglement can be produced. (54)] and cannot be separable into a pair of functions involving only Figure 3(a) shows the resulting entropy for this limit as a function of the fluctuation strength \\u03c3122\\u2060. Interestingly, this shows a maximum in the entanglement for \\u03c3122\\u22481.33\\u2060. This can be understood in the following way. In the limit that \\u03c3122 is small, fluctuations are simply too weak to generate entanglement. On the other hand, large fluctuations also appear to prevent the formation of entangled states. The maximum then falls in the limit of being neither too soft nor too hard. The photon scattering is described by the interaction Hamiltonian29 Evaluation of the integrals in the scattering Hamiltonian (B3) requires a model for the sample polarizability operator \\u03b1^(r)\\u2060. Let us consider delocalized cavity polariton modes which we described by operator In this appendix, we derive an explicit form of the single-mode and cross-mode cumulant functions using the correlation functions for stochastic Gaussian processes given in Eqs. (48) and (49), respectively. Evaluation of time ordered integral in Eq. (46) with the correlation function given by Eq. (48) results in a well known form of the second cumulant28 Quantum computing for chemistry and physics applications from a Monte Carlo perspective\",\n",

      "    \"full_text\": \"In a new study, scientists from the US and Taiwan have theoretically demonstrated the existence of a universal lower bound on topological entanglement entropy, which is always non-negative. The findings are published in the journal Physical Review Letters. Quantum systems are bizarre and follow their own rules, with quantum states telling us everything we know about that system. Topological entanglement entropy (TEE) is a measure that provides insights into emergent non-local phenomena and entanglement in quantum systems with topological properties. Given the fundamental role of quantum entanglement in quantum computing and various information applications, understanding TEE becomes essential for gaining insights into the behavior of quantum systems. In quantum systems, it's often observed that the entanglement entropies follow an area law. This means that the entanglement between particles or regions is related to the area of the boundary that separates them. TEE is a specific term within the entanglement entropy that provides additional information. It's like a correction term that characterizes the topological phase of the system. In condensed matter physics, a topological phase refers to a specific state of matter characterized by unique topological properties. These properties are associated with the behavior of particles within the material, such as anyons, and can be distinguished by their TEE values. \\\"TEE is a fascinating thing. By computing the entanglement entropy from a single ground state, we can learn the number of species of anyons (emergent particles that are neither boson nor fermion) of the phase of matter. It came out 18 years ago. I believe many people got inspiration from it. The research area I work on may not exist without these early works,\\\" Dr. Bowen Shi, lead author of the study, told Phys.org. In many models, TEE is thought to have a universal value that characterizes the properties of the underlying topological phase. However, this is not always the case. TEE can differ between two states that are related by constant-depth circuits. These circuits are a specific type of quantum circuit operation that performs a series of quantum gates or transformations in a way that restricts their depth, meaning the number of sequential operations. The key idea is that these circuits manipulate quantum states, and according to the theory, states related by such circuits should be in the same phase because the operations don't significantly alter the underlying physics. However, this isn't always the case, and the variations in TEE between such states are often referred to as spurious TEE. Dr. Shi underscores the transformative power of TEE, saying, \\\"The first time I read the original TEE papers, I was in graduate school studying particle physics. Now, I study emergent particles, where certain properties naturally emerge with large degrees of freedom. My collaborators and I argued that we can now use a single wave function and the entanglement area law to predict the emergence of anyons and the correct TEE value.\\\" Essentially, they have a tool for understanding and predicting the behavior of emergent particles and their entanglement characteristics. The researchers wanted to understand the reliability of extracting universal properties from a ground-state wave function. To explore this, they focused on two-dimensional (2D) gapped ground states. These states exist in 2D systems, such as thin films or 2D materials, and are characterized by an energy gap that separates the ground state from higher-energy excited states. This energy gap ensures the stability and well-defined nature of the ground state, making it an ideal platform for investigating TEE. Following this, they introduced noise to the gapped ground states using a constant-depth circuit. This noise is akin to perturbations or disturbances in the system. They aimed to observe how the spurious TEE changed when the gapped ground state was perturbed. What they found was truly remarkable. \\\"We found that the new state must extract a larger value of TEE than the state without noise. In other words, the so-called spurious topological entanglement entropy is always non-negative,\\\" explained Dr. Shi. This basically means there is a universal lower bound on TEE, which is consistently non-negative. In simple terms, the entanglement entropy within these 2D gapped ground states remains non-negative, regardless of the perturbations introduced by the constant-depth circuit. Dr. Shi compared this to a glass being always lighter once we wipe away the dust on its surface. Wiping away dust from a glass doesn't make it heavier but rather reveals its true weight. Similarly, adding noise doesn't decrease the TEE but reveals an additional, non-negative TEE in the system. Furthermore, the researchers made an important observation: TEE is invariant under constant-depth quantum circuits. This makes it a useful tool for understanding the underlying topological phase of the ground state. Speaking of the potential practical implications of their research, Dr. Shi said, \\\"TEE computation is essential for identifying a material's underlying phase. Previous studies revealed that TEE formula failure in noisy states introduced uncertainty in results. Our lower bound reduces half of this uncertainty, offering practical value. With the rise of quantum computing and preparation of quantum states, our findings may also aid in these states.\\\" The discovery of a universal lower bound on TEE, which is always non-negative, underscores the robustness of this entanglement measure even in the presence of perturbations introduced by constant-depth circuits. There are still uncharted territories in this field. The researchers have laid the foundation for further investigations, such as exploring the generality of noise's impact on spurious TEE, specifically the role of constant-depth circuits, and delving into the behavior of TEE at finite temperatures. These open questions promise exciting prospects for future research in the study of quantum systems.

      "    \"full_text\": \"One of the few clues to the connection between quantum mechanics (the physical theory of elementary particles, atoms and radiation) and the theory of general relativity (the theory of gravitation and cosmology), is the remarkable prediction of so-called \\u201cHawking Radiation\\u201d from black holes.1 According to the Hawking calculation, black holes \\u2013 regions of space from which no information can escape \\u2013 are fundamentally unstable and evaporate, radiating away their mass and energy. And even though black holes have a physical temperature of exactly absolute zero, the radiation emitted by black holes is that of a perfect thermal body at a temperature proportional to 1/M, where M is the mass of the black hole. In fact, the temperature actually increases as the black hole loses mass and evaporates! Since the radiation is essentially thermal noise, it carries no information about the internal state of the black hole and is therefore consistent with the definition of a black hole. Moreover, it seems that the thermodynamic analogy is quite complete: black holes are believed to possess an entropy, or \\u201cdegree of disorder,\\u201d just as any ordinary body at a nonzero temperature would, even though they are at absolute zero physical temperature and have no internal structure whatsoever. It is now appreciated that black hole entropy is a particular example of a more general phenomenon known as horizon entropy. A horizon is the boundary between two regions of the universe that are causally out of contact. Information about events in one region cannot propagate, even in principle, to the other region. Remarkably, all horizons must radiate random thermal energy and possess entropy proportional to their surface area, even though the horizon itself and its surroundings are simply empty space \\u2013a vacuum \\u2013 at zero temperature! To appreciate this strange result, it is useful to construct a horizon without the complications of black holes and general relativity. For example, if a driver heading eastbound on the Long Island Expressway accelerates uniformly (suppose the speed of the car increases by 5 mph every second), the driver has actually created a space-time horizon about three light years west of the car. As long as the driver continues to accelerate, the state of affairs in the universe three light years to the west will always be unknown to the driver (see Figure 1). In effect, the driver is disconnected from that part of the universe by a horizon. Looking in the westward direction at the space-time horizon, the driver would detect, in principle, the faint radiant heat and entropy of a thermal body at a temperature less than a billionth of a billionth of a degree above absolute zero \\u2013 horizon entropy and temperature. The fact that horizon entropy behaves in most respects just like \\u201ctextbook\\u201d thermodynamic entropy \\u2013 the entropy accorded molecules moving randomly about \\u2013 is a deeply mysterious fact. For instance, horizon entropy combined with ordinary thermodynamic entropy obeys a generalized second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of the universe must increase or stay constant. But the horizon is not a physical object or collection of things, such as a gas of molecules \\u2013 it is simply an empty piece of space. And it is not even a distinguished empty piece of space in the universe: the other non-accelerating drivers on the Long Island Expressway would observe that particular piece of space as unremarkable. What is the entropy, and exactly where is it, if there is nothing but empty space at the horizon? Unfortunately, there are no satisfactory answers to these questions. But a striking connection between two very different fields of physics has emerged in the last several years that gives a new perspective to these questions \\u2013 even if no ready answers are available. The new perspective about black holes, horizons and general relativity surprisingly comes from the condensed matter physics field of quantum computing and quantum information theory. Another peculiar feature of information emerges when it is made to conform to the laws of quantum mechanics: according to quantum mechanics, information cannot be copied with perfect fidelity. However, information can be moved by destroying it in one place and creating it in another \\u2013 a process now called \\u201cteleportation.\\u201d Teleportation first involves the sender (Alice) and receiver (Bob) sharing an entangled quantum state (Figure 2). For instance, using the example of Alice and Bob, the state S = 01+10 is created, and Alice and Bob each take one of the atoms. To send information to Bob, Alice must entangle the information state she wishes to send with her part of the entangled resource she shares with Bob. Then, after making a particular measurement on the combined quantum system she now holds, the information disappears from Alice\\u2019s atoms and instantaneously appears in Bob\\u2019s atoms.2 Classical computers do not have the features I have described above because their information bits are being continuously reset into their determined states (this is, in part, what runs down the batteries on your laptop). Entanglement is the quantum counterpart of a wire, or channel, connecting sender to receiver, through which information is sent. Like all wires, it has an intrinsic capacity to carry information; for instance, the CAT 5 patch cord that connects your computer to the wall jack can carry about 100 million bits of information every second. Trying to send more information would result in the corruption of some of the information that you are trying to send. Unsurprisingly, the capacity of a quantum channel is simply the number of pairs of bits, entangled in the manner of state S, that are shared between sender and receiver. Even though entropy has the connotation of disorder and randomness, entropy and quantum information are intimately connected. Before the state S is used to teleport information, a measurement of either shared atom would yield a 0 or 1 with equal probability. Suppose a new batch of states, ready to teleport information, was cooked up and Alice decides to test some of them (for quality control) by measuring her atoms. If they all yielded the same answers (all 1s for instance), she would conclude that this batch must be uncorrelated with Bob\\u2019s counterpart atoms and it would therefore be flawed. Entanglements between quantum objects manifest themselves as fluctuations in the measured properties of those objects, and the fluctuations, in turn, are perceived as randomness or entropy when measurements are made. This entanglement entropy is a measure of the information capacity of a quantum channel. Such \\u201cman-made\\u201d entanglements have been demonstrated recently to teleport information over distances more than 100 kilometers. A naturally occurring kind of entanglement seems to be responsible for the fluctuations we perceive as horizon entropy. But what, exactly, is entangled in the empty space surrounding a horizon? In an old-fashioned television picture tube, electrons are accelerated through a vacuum where they strike a fluorescent screen and make a picture. When the picture tube is on, electrons move, say, to the left because every successive point in space to the left of the electron is at a higher voltage. In setting the voltage at each point in space, the vacuum has been \\u201cimprinted\\u201d with some information that tells the electron how to move. But the laws of quantum mechanics govern information, even if that information exists in empty space! Suppose we encode the instructions for the motion of an electron by a series of bits, which in turn, correspond to the voltages at each point in empty space. The voltage at each point may be thought of as an atom in either an excited state (1) or the ground state (0). A 01 combination of adjacent \\u201cvoltage bits\\u201d tells the electron to move to the right; a 10 combination tells it to move to the left; and the electron does nothing at all if it encounters a 00 or 11. One possible quantum state is shown in Figure 3. Given that the picture tube has the capacity to be used in this way \\u2013 voltage bits set in a particular way to move electrons around as needed \\u2013 what is the natural state of the voltage bits when the picture tube is \\u201coff \\u201d? That is, what is the state of the voltage bits when we haven\\u2019t applied any voltages and set them to any particular values? This is what physicists refer to as the quantum state of the vacuum (and it is not as ridiculous as it sounds). What we call empty space \\u2013 space devoid of matter or energy \\u2013 corresponds to the voltage bits being in their lowest energy state. One might think that the lowest energy quantum state for the set of voltages (called a quantum field) is all 0s (or all 1s) in Figure 3 \\u2013 but nothing could be further from the truth! The lowest energy state has enormous complexity and behaves as if each voltage bit is entangled with every other. Just like atoms, voltage bits are able to lower their energy by sharing their excited states with other voltage bits and producing entangled states like S. This feature follows from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that an excited state can lower its momentum and energy by making its position highly uncertain. If I denote by Sij the state in which the voltage bit at point i is entangled with the voltage bit at point j (that is, Sij=0i1j+1i0 j), the lowest energy state, F, of the quantum field is a superposition of every different way that the voltage bits can be paired into states like S. An example for four voltage bits is shown in Figure 4a. Multiplying out all such products reveals that every possible combination of 0s and 1s appear with some probability (Figure 4b).3 This is the secret life of voltages inside the dark, unplugged television tube sitting in your attic and, for that matter, the empty space all around us. Why, then, doesn\\u2019t an electron see these voltages and spontaneously begin to move randomly about in empty space? The reason is that for the electron to gain some energy and move about, the quantum field must lose some energy \\u2013 but it is already in the lowest energy state so it can\\u2019t lose any more. Suppose we make an imaginary partition in the middle of an empty box, with Alice in possession of the voltage bits on the left and Bob in possession of those on the right (see Figure 4b). If Bob measures and determines the values of his bits, Alice\\u2019s bits instantaneously assume their correlated values. The resulting energy of the part of the quantum field belonging to Alice will sometimes have a large energy and sometimes a small energy depending on the random outcomes of Bob\\u2019s measurements. An electron placed on Alice\\u2019s side would move randomly, exchanging energy with the random energy changes of the quantum field. The random motion is effected only through those entangled pairs of voltage bits straddling the partition, and the number of such pairs is proportional to the surface area of the partition. From Alice\\u2019s perspective, the random energy and motion is ascribed to the electron being in thermal contact with a body possessing temperature and entropy \\u2013 the imaginary partition of the box. It is clear that entanglement entropy is a highly non-local quantity as it involves the knowledge of the quantum state of fields at every point in space. In contrast, more familiar local quantities such as energy and momentum are properties of individual particles or points in space. My research in the past several years has been to develop a local picture for entanglement entropy. Even though computing entanglement entropy across a horizon depends on knowing the quantum fields everywhere on either side of the horizon, the answer, paradoxically, only depends upon the surface area of the horizon. The area factor comes from enumerating all of the entangled pairs in the ground state of the quantum field that straddle the horizon. A few years ago, I realized that the kind of quantum operator that counts these pairs is closely related to what is known as a boundary changing operator. One might picture the action of such an operator as the creation of a twist in a fabric ribbon that is held at both ends. To create a twist, one end of the ribbon must be released and twisted; then the twist may be pushed to any location. Although the location of the twist is seemingly well localized in one place, its creation must have involved manipulation of the field all the way out to the boundary. However, in a two-dimensional space-time, an exact transformation (known as a duality) exists that can turn a non-local, boundary-changing operator into a local one. Through this transformation, the entanglement entropy of a gas of photons (the \\u201cvoltage\\u201d bits) in a two-dimensional space-time is turned into the conventional thermal entropy of a one dimensional gas of \\u201cboundary-changing particles.\\u201d The original entangled photons do not interact with one another, but the boundary-changing particles interact very strongly with one another, giving rise to a very strange \\u201cboundary\\u201d thermodynamics from which I was able to derive the entanglement entropy.4 My results were confirmed computationally (about a year after I published them) by Ingo Peschel and colleagues in Berlin.5 However, it seems that the duality trick only works in a two-dimensional space-time, precisely because the infinite \\u201cribbon\\u201d can only represent one spatial dimension. Even with this limitation, this work has given a technical meaning to horizon entropy as a property of the boundary between two regions rather than the regions themselves. 1. Hawking, S.W.

Alice must additionally send some conventional information to Bob for him to unambiguously decode the message. Without such a feature, teleportation would allow communication faster than the speed of light. 3.

      "    \"full_text\": \"In physics, \\u201cuniversality\\u201d refers to properties of systems that are independent of their details. Establishing the universality of quantum dynamics is one of the key interests of theoretical physicists. Now, researchers from Japan have identified such a universality in disordered quantum systems, characterized by a one-parameter scaling for surface roughness and entanglement entropy (a measure of quantum entanglement). Many-particle systems in the real world are often imbued with \\u201cdisorder\\u201d or \\u201crandomness.\\u201d This, in turn, leads to the occurrence of phenomena unique to such systems. For instance, electrons in strongly disordered systems can become localized due to destructive interference, a phenomenon known as \\u201cAnderson localization.\\u201d Anderson localization has been studied extensively in terms of one-parameter scaling, where system properties are scaled based on one specific parameter. But while most studies have focused on static properties, disorder can also significantly influence quantum dynamics such as entanglement dynamics and transport phenomena. In a recent study published in Physical Review Letters, a team of physicists led by Prof. Kazuya Fujimoto from Nagoya University has now demonstrated numerically a dynamical one-parameter scaling called \\u201cFamily-Vicsek (FV) scaling\\u201d for disordered quantum systems. \\u201cWhile the FV scaling is originally known from classical surface growth, we found the scaling in random quantum systems by introducing a \\u2018quantum surface height operator\\u2019,\\u201d explains Prof. Fujimoto. In their study, the physicists considered a system of non-interacting spinless fermions in a disordered one-dimensional potential for three common models. They found that the surface roughness followed FV scaling characterized with three exponents. Further numerical analysis showed that the surface roughness could be related to the entanglement entropy (EE), thus indicating an FV-type scaling for EE. In addition, they observed anomalous scaling exponents for one of the models and attributed it to the presence of localized states in a delocalized phase, a classic signature of quantum disordered systems. Importantly, surface roughness can be measured experimentally for cold-atomic systems using microscopy techniques, which makes the experimental estimation of EE viable in non-interacting fermions. \\u201cThese findings will deepen our understanding of nonequilibrium physics and provide a novel viewpoint to classify the universal non-equilibrium phenomena emerging in random quantum systems,\\u201d says Prof. Fujimoto. While the findings of the study do not have a direct influence on our daily lives, they certainly pave the way for a better understanding of real-world quantum systems.\",\n",

      "    \"full_text\": \"In the past week, I have rediscovered writing. Writing really hurts, you know\\u2026 I\\u2019m pretty sure there should be workplace regulations for pen and paper safety, with regular mandatory hand massages against cramps and such. I guess my hand injuries came from overuse, because I filled up two entire notepads with my notes on all the talks at the Information Universe 4 conference. So, as I asked in the title, what do entropy, entanglement, cosmology, life, and fake news have in common? The answer is: information. \\u201cWhat do you mean, information?\\u201d, you may demand sternly. This was also the topic of many Q&A sessions and coffee breaks. Two main definitions seem to be those of: To communicate meaning, you need some encoding scheme of information (like an alphabet), and a commonly understood standard (like a language). This is probably what most people think of when they talk about information: stuff you can read about, knowledge. However, the underlying truth that you\\u2019re trying to communicate about is there independent of your messages. Such truths for instance describe the exact state of a bunch of molecules at a certain time: where they are, how fast they move, in what directions, what type of molecules they are, etc., etc. Buckets (or canisters, or tubs, or vast intergalactic expanses) of molecules are typically described by statistical physics and thermodynamics, but the kind of statistical description about states of things can be generalized to anything. The unit of information of this kind is the bit. Now, when you write down the equations of how all this information builds up in a system you get something called Shannon entropy. To be honest, I\\u2019m not sure whether I like the word \\u201cinformation\\u201d in this context, because it\\u2019s actually more about probability. Surprisal seems like a much better word to me. But I digress. It turns out that there are several ways information entropy can describe our Universe in ways that solve some of the biggest problems in cosmological physics: these theories naturally unify gravity and quantum physics and explain the mysteries of Dark Matter and Dark Energy. At the conference two such theories were presented and discussed: The theory of entropic or emergent gravity by Erik Verlinde and collaborators, in a little over a decade, seems to have moved from wild theoretical speculation into the realm of serious possibility. In several talks, observational tests were discussed that interestingly seem to match old alternative theories of gravity like MOND as well. Also super interesting was new work by Manus Visser on how even Newton\\u2019s first and second laws (that describe mass inertia and how anything moves at all) can be explained from entropic principles! The math was beyond me, honestly, which is a problem with all of entropic gravity, being based on the information entropy of the entanglement of primordial particles on (or beyond?) opposite parts of the horizon of some kind of anti-de Sitter (AdS) space that supposedly corresponds to our own (conformal space? CF) Universe by means of AdS/CFT correspondence. Still, the predictions are impressive, elegant, enticing and certainly warrant further attention. Stephen Wolfram (yes, the Mathematica guy) presented the Wolfram theory of physics. The Wolfram Universe starts from a description of space itself as a graph of \\u201cspace-element\\u201d nodes connected to other nodes. Updates to the cells and connections in this graph \\u2014 representing the passing of time \\u2014 can be made according to certain rules. Such cell update schemes were inspired by cellular automata (which you can very nicely simulate in Mathematica, try it today!). Wolfram claimed (I wouldn\\u2019t say explained, although I\\u2019m sure they try on their website) that when you make this graph big enough and use the right set of update rules, you again get an emergent theory of physics. The most interesting part of his talk was that he had some very specific predictions for things that could be observed if indeed we live in a Wolfram Universe (did you try Mathematica yet btw? great product\\u2026). One was that the 3-dimensional nature of the spacetime we experience isn\\u2019t necessarily fixed in the Wolfriverse and we could observe flashes of other-dimensionality somehow. Another thing would be a specific radiation pattern from near the event horizon of a black hole. Henk Hoekstra gave a great overview of the Euclid project, which combines a (hopefully soon to be launched) space telescope with ground-based telescope observations to create a new, high resolution map of all the stuff in our local corner of the Universe. \\u201cAll the stuff\\u201d includes dark matter. Of course, we cannot see that stuff (hence the name), but using intricate statistical modeling of tiny distortions of light by the gravity of the stuff \\u2014 a phenomenon known as (weak) gravitational lensing \\u2014 we can deduce where it\\u2019s located. Knowing that is really important for understanding all the processes going on and the objects and structures that we see in our neighborhood. Without this knowledge, we simply cannot test our theories. A related promising new idea is to use strong gravitational lensing of quasars and even supernovae. To understand strong lensing, take a look at a light source through the bottom of a wine glass: The light of an object is bent around a heavy foreground object from multiple sides, giving us two (or more) views on a single background object! The light from those two images travelled along different paths, with different distances. Now, quasars and supernovae are both transients: objects that change color or brightness over time. If their light travels different distances, we can measure their time-dependent light pattern twice (or more). The punchline is that the differences in the light patterns from the multiple images can tell us something about the Universe! By travelling different distances, or travelling through different environments, their patterns will often be slightly different. Kind of a long story, but the bottom line is that this is really promising as a completely new probe of the physics of our Universe, one that is independent of other observational probes we have used up to now. One of the most important cosmological parameters that describe our Universe as a whole is the Hubble constant. This constant can be measured in several ways. Simplifying a bit, we can say that there are two classes of observations: those from the early-time universe (most prominently: the cosmic microwave background (CMB), popularly described as the echo of the Big Bang) and those from the late-time universe (now and just a few billion years ago, e.g. supernova distances). For years, different Hubble constant measurements seemed to be converging to a single value (within the error margins). However, with measurements becoming more and more precise (error margins becoming smaller), it now turns out that CMB measurements do not agree at all with late-time measurements! This so-called \\u201cHubble tension\\u201d has grown over the last decade into a serious crisis. Obviously, scientists love a good crisis, because it means that there\\u2019s something new to learn just lurking beyond the horizon! The talks by Leon Koopmans, Tamara Davis and Nikki Arendse provided many perspectives on this issue, but no solution has been found yet. Improving our understanding of our surroundings in the ways presented by e.g. Job Feldbrugge (who uses analytical models to simplify and better understand the complex universe around us) and Yan-Chuan Cai (who improves modelling of one of the most essential astronomical tools: the redshift as used to estimate distances to objects) will certainly play a role as well. \\u2026it will be in any intelligence\\u2019s interest to cooperate. This goes for us humans, when we work together, but also goes for AGI and anything in between that allows us to increase our intelligence (tools like books, computers, AI, etc.). So: no, we needn\\u2019t fear AGI at all\\u2026 at least, as long as they are Spinozans. One interesting random cross-connection from this talk is that Wolfram\\u2019s set of all the possible update rules \\u2014 a concept they call the Ruliad, and which describes all possible Universes \\u2014 was described in a very similar way to Spinoza\\u2019s God. Maybe the similarity is just due to the nature of things that explain everything always everywhere, though. Some speakers discussed what life is, whether we should define it at all, how it could have come about, and also how it connects to things like AGI. The talks ranged from quite generic and understandable to very technical, like the talk by David Eric Smith. Although it was challenging for me to follow due to lots of jargon, Smith argued convincingly, based on (micro)biological evidence, that ribosomes, the molecules that fold proteins out of RNA, must have come before the actual RNA/DNA that would become the basic information carrier of all life as we know it. Digging into this chain of events on how life could have started is a fascinating feat of micro-archaeology, if one may call it that... And one may, if one is to follow the definition of life that Charley Lineweaver gives. He states that essentially biology is a historical science. All other definitions of life are problematic and may exclude things like viruses and even humans (we need to eat; how self-sustaining are we?) or include such things as tornados and stars (\\u201csystems far from equilibrium\\u201d). The study of life is simply a study of how some subset of things we call \\u201cliving\\u201d happened to come about. He contrasts this to physics which tries to uncover time-invariant truths about reality. Finally, one talk that really hit home for me was the one by Ruurd Oosterwoud on countering disinformation using evidence-based, data-driven solutions. Using such solutions may seem like the obvious thing to do, but unfortunately, politically driven solutions often are far from effective. This is no big surprise, because many simply have not been rigorously tested at all. The problem we face is hugely complex, though, with many different actors through many different media with many different motivations and stakes. Solutions like fact-checking create merely a ripple in the huge lake of false information that floods us from all sides. And this doesn\\u2019t even include yet aspects like intent: do people truly believe what they say or are they actively trying to disrupt any fact-based discussion? Oosterwoud presented a number of ways in which we can actually start measuring what works and what doesn\\u2019t. One cool example was a website where school children were given the assignment to come up with a fake news item themselves and get as many visitors to it as possible. This gives both the children themselves and researchers insights into successful tactics, which may eventually lead to counter-strategies that actually work. Apart from the content and the great discussions over coffee, the conference was held in the DOT full-dome planetarium. Some of the speakers made use of this to show some beautiful full-dome movies or interactive shows. It\\u2019s one of the most inspiring conferences for technically inclined, but broadly interested people.\",\n",

       "'Entanglement entropy is a fundamental quantity in quantum mechanics, reflecting the quantum correlations between subsystems of a larger quantum system. It plays a crucial role in various fields, including condensed matter physics, quantum information science, and the study of black holes. Entanglement entropy is defined using the reduced density matrix of a subsystem after tracing out the rest of the system, and it is quantified by the von Neumann entropy of this reduced density matrix.\\n\\nThe scaling behavior of entanglement entropy can provide insights into the degrees of freedom and nonlocal correlations within a quantum system. It is particularly useful in analyzing states within the ground state space and can assist in identifying long-range order, detecting topological phases, and studying phase transitions, even when an order parameter is not known. In holographic theories, entanglement entropy can be computed using specific geometric prescriptions.\\n\\nEntanglement entropy also has theoretical implications in understanding the quantum structure of spacetime and has been linked with the entropy of black holes through holographic principles. Various measures such as the Rényi entropies have been considered, and holographic methods have been developed to evaluate entanglement entropy in the context of gauge/gravity duality.\\n\\nIn practical computations, entanglement entropy can be affected by factors such as dispersion relations, the dimensionality of the space-time, and the presence of a UV cutoff, leading to divergences that require regularization. Furthermore, the behavior of entanglement entropy is influenced by whether states are pure or mixed, and in the case of gauge theories, by the non-localizability of states in space.\\n\\nThere is a rich body of work exploring entanglement entropy from various perspectives, including its role in nonlocal field theories, the Renyi entropy, its relationship to c-functions in conformal field theories, and its behavior in non-conformal backgrounds. The concept is also being extended beyond traditional entanglement measures to account for both spacelike and timelike components, investigating its dynamics near equilibrium, and linking it with the thermodynamic arrow of time.\\n\\nOverall, entanglement entropy serves as a versatile and powerful tool for probing quantum correlations and understanding the fabric of quantum systems, with implications spanning from fundamental physics to potential applications in quantum technologies.'"
